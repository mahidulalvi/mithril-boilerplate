# mithril-boilerplate

Mithril boilerplate is a template for creating front-end SPAs using [`mithril`](https://mithril.js.org/) framework and will include technologies that are compatible and frequently used in other reactive frameworks such as `redux`, `redux-saga` and `reselect`(reduxjs/reselect) etc. It will follow development best practices while offering the most flexibility to create Applications in a fast and effective method.

Although there are lots of other templates using different view libraries, Mithril is smaller in size, faster in performance and is cross-browser compatible. It also has built-in routing and XHR utilities. More on [`mithril`](https://mithril.js.org/) documentation.

Inspiration from [`react-boilerplate`](https://github.com/react-boilerplate/react-boilerplate).
